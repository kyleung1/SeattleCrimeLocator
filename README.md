The function of this app is to locate the location of the user by their ip address or by a location entered in the textbox and to find the nearest crime that occured in the greater Seattle area. Details such as the date and time, the type of offense, the relative location and the distance from the user are shown. This project uses javascript, html, and css.

Some challenges were figuring out how to implement apis and figuring out how to calculate the distances between the user and the crime. 

The purpose of this project was to learn how to utilize apis and to learn javascript.
